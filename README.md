# VKmusicID3

**VKmusicID3** helps to download music from a VK account.

## Features
* Downloads in multiple threads
* Changes ID3 tags of downloaded songs to the ones that used in VK in order to represent them correctly on your MP3 player or Last.fm account
* Saves lyrics to both TXT files and UNSYNCEDLYRICS tag
* Supports UTF-8, so your Japanese music library will be all right

## Update
VK is killing music API for developers! This application will not work anymore, unless new method to access music is implemeted. VK policy and management are becoming worse every year and I'm not going to use it anymore. Thus, I won't support this application anymore.   

It's still a great example of creating GUI application purely in F# involving many things (WPF, asynchronous workflows, MVVM, etc).
